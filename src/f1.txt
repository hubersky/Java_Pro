Who is the greatest of all time in F1 racing? This is a highly debated topic, but we’ll give a quick rundown. Lewis
Hamilton has the most F1 wins, most pole positions and has the joint-record of World Championships. Juan Manuel Fangio
has the top winning percentage of all time with 46.15%, winning 24 of 52. Ayrton Senna died at 34 in the prime of his
career, but everyone still considers him the fastest driver in an F1 car. And who can overlook Michael Schumacher’s 7
World Championships. Who’s your pick?
